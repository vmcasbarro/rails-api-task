<h2>Planning</h2>
This project was a great learning experience for me! It was essential for me to have several iterations of my project in mind to manage features I wanted to add. I kept myself on task by keeping a running list of features I wanted to change, modify, or create. This way, when I thought of a new feature (usually while working on a different one), I could write it down and keep it for later instead of getting side tracked.

<h2>Future Directions</h2>
One of my goals for this project is to add functionality for shared lists between users as well as chat functionality as a side-bar.

<h2>Current Limitations</h2>
I was able to build out the ERD and tables for the chat application; however I ran out of time during the project week to get them to production-quality. I had to make difficult decisions regarding managing the scope of this project, which ultimately led to me delivering less functionality than initially intended.
